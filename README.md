- 👋 Hi, I’m @bridgettedunn (beginner trying to enhance skills via self-ed and collaborative opportunities).
- 👀 I’ve (self) studied HTML, CSS, beginners Javascript.  I try to learn as much as possible via free or affordable sources.  I live in middle of nowhere 
and need the skills to be able to work remotely (and find work that will allow for that).  I would do temporary work for free if it adds to my skillset.  Sometimes I 
feel like I spend more time searching for good learning material than actually learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...  (or trying to learn) C#/Unity for 2-d games (will check out Core as well which uses Lua I think), animation with tweening
(to make short cartoons with custom digital art).   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything that enhances my skillset.  I'd be interested in being part of creating/providing educational material via fun games (something I've been 
interested in for over a decade).  My language skills are pretty strong (I self-taught Spanish and Bulgarian, tested out of most university level 
spanish courses afterwards) or any sort of interactive education (my major was Language/spanish teaching w/ minor in Geography, sadly was short one semester to graduate w/ BA).
Art-wise, I painted for many years (acrylic on canvas or wood, and also held a sub-contractors license and did murals and faux finishes), 
so trying to make the switch to digital art, tweening, related coding, etc.  Also a self-taught stock trader but I don't enjoy fin-tech so much.
- 📫 How to reach me ... e-mail (my same name with 3 sevens on the end at gmail.   or fb, same name, in Western NC.
